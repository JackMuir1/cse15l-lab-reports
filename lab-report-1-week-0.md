# Lab 1 - Week 0
This weeks lab was an exploration in making and editing a markdown-formatted github page using github in browser, github on desktop, and visual studio code. I began by making the [index file](index.md) where all my lab reports will be stored, then added links to navigate between lab reports.

Here is a screenshot of what my index page looked like when I first started. After completing the lab, the site is looking much better thanks to Markdown!

I also created a page with examples of all uses of markdown. You can check that out here --> [Markdown Demo](Markdown-Demo.md)

Thats all for the first lab, I am excited to learn further!
